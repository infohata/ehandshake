# ehandshake

Increasing user security via decentralised trust networks:

E-handshake is a solution is to create trust relationship networks, using smart contracts, that will encourage e-commerce platforms to increase measures towards user security and privacy. Relationship of trust between parties is linked to a successful transaction between them and must be authenticated by both parties. This will be stored on the EOS blockchain. We aim to create a community that will facilitate and increase security through trusted relationships, to enable new and current market participants to transact with more confidence.

## Structure
